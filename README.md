sim-shootout
============

Code for the blog series on benchmarking nearest-neighbour libraries:

[Part I: Intro](http://radimrehurek.com/2013/11/performance-shootout-of-nearest-neighbours-intro/)

[Part II: Contestants](http://radimrehurek.com/2013/12/performance-shootout-of-nearest-neighbours-contestants/)

[Part III: Querying](http://radimrehurek.com/2014/01/performance-shootout-of-nearest-neighbours-querying/)

The target are libraries that expose a Python interface and allow (exact or approximate) k-NN search in high dimensional vector spaces.

Run `run_all.sh` to download Wikipedia, index it and run all experiments.
